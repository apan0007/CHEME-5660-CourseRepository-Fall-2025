Before we do the [Net Present Value (NPV) calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value#:~:text=NPV%20is%20the%20sum%20of,NPV%20results%20in%20a%20loss.), we'll set up some components and constants that we'll use later.\n",
    "* __Task 1__: Setup the Cash Flow Dictionary. In this task, we specify some values for the cash flow events we observe over the lifetime of owning the [Tesla Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models). Then, we construct a net cash flow dictionary that holds the net values for the cash flow events during each period.\n",
    "* __Task 2__: In this task, we compute a dictionary of discount factor $\\mathcal{D}_{j,0}(\\bar{r})$ values using the time and discount rate data specified in the Prerequisites section.\n",
    "* __Task 3__: In this task, we'll compute the net present value (NPV) for the [Tesla Model S](https://www.tesla.com/models) and answer some discussion questions about how the value may change if we change our assumptions and how we should interpret the values produced by the calculation.\n",
