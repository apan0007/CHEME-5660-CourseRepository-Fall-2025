    "\n",

    "__Initialization:__ Given two initial guesses $x_0$ and $x_1$, a tolerance level $\\epsilon>0$, a maximum number of iterations $\\texttt{maxiter}$, a convergence flag $\\texttt{converged}\\gets\\texttt{false}$ and an iteration counter $i\\gets{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Parameter Selection Rules of Thumb:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Tolerance ($\\epsilon$)**: For financial calculations like YTM, a tolerance of $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ to $10^{-8}$ is typically appropriate. This provides accuracy to about 6-8 decimal places, which is sufficient for most practical applications. For YTM calculations, $\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ corresponds to about 0.0001% accuracy in the yield estimate.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">**Maximum iterations ($\\texttt{maxiter}$)**: For well-behaved functions like the NPV equation for YTM, the secant method typically converges within 10-20 iterations. A safe choice is $\\texttt{maxiter} = 50$ to $100$. If convergence hasn't occurred by then, it usually indicates a problem with the initial guesses or the function itself.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Initial guesses**: For YTM calculations, reasonable starting values are often $x_0 = 0.01$ (1%) and $x_1 = 0.10$ (10%), which bracket typical bond yields. The secant method is generally robust to the choice of initial guesses as long as they're not too close together.\n",

    "While not $\\texttt{converged}$ and $i\\leq\\texttt{maxiter}$ __do__:\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "   where $f(x_i)$ and $f(x_{i-1})$ are the function values at the current and previous estimates, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Convergence Properties for YTM Calculations:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The secant method exhibits **superlinear convergence** for YTM calculations under typical conditions, with several important characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence Rate**: The secant method has a convergence order of approximately 1.618 (the golden ratio), which means it converges faster than linear methods but slower than Newton's method (quadratic convergence). In practice, this means the number of accurate decimal places increases by about 60% with each iteration once near the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Secant well-suited for YTM calculations**: The NPV function for coupon note (bond) pricing is smooth, continuous, and monotonically decreasing with respect to the discount rate. This makes it an ideal candidate for the secant method because:\n",
    "  - The function has a unique root (the YTM)\n",
    "  - There are no discontinuities or sharp turns that could cause convergence issues\n",
    "  - The derivative doesn't change sign, ensuring stable convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Convergence Behavior**: For YTM calculations, the secant method typically converges within a _few_ iterations, i.e., not thousands when starting with reasonable initial guesses (e.g., 1% and 10%). \n",
    "\n",
    "While Newton's method converges faster, it requires computing the derivative of the NPV function. The secant method achieves good convergence _without_ this additional computational complexity, making it attractive for YTM calculations.\n",
